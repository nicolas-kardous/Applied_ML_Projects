Parts 2 and 3 are medium difficult, but there are plenty of opportunities to get confused with python data structures, so if you're going to get stuck, get stuck (and unstuck) early!\n",

    "In this assignment, you'll be analyzing movie reviews in an attempt to determine whether movies are good or bad.  I've downloaded a large number of movie reviews from the [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) website, which are available in the file \"reviews.csv\" on Canvas.  I've also put a file \"movies.dat\" on Canvas that contains metadata for ~65,000 different movies\n",

It's a meta-review website that aggregates movie reviews from a large number of critics.  Here's what the page for this year's [Oscar winner](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_shape_of_water_2017) looks like.  Note in particular the section on \"Critic Reviews\" at the bottom -- that's the content that has been scraped and put in the reviews.csv file.  Also note that each movie is given a quantitative score on the Tomatometer which is used to classify the movie as either Fresh (good) or Rotten (bad).\n",

    "Your mission is to develop a classifier to determine whether a movie is Fresh or Rotten based on the contents of the reviews given to the movie.  As usual, we'll start out with some exploratory data analysis."

    "### 1.4 Ratings over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `movies` dataset, create a plot that shows how the average rating per movie (rtAllCriticsRating) has evolved over time.  Do this by creating a scatterplot where the x-axis is the year in which the movie was released and the y-axis is rtAllCriticsRating.  Drop movies with 0 or unknown values to avoid biasing your results.  Then, create a scatterplot that has one <year,rating> point for each remaining movie, and pick an appropriate size/color/transparency for these points to ensure that the graph looks professional.  In other words, do not simply use the default settings, as this will produce a dense mess of dots that will be hard to interpret.  Finally, overlay on this scatterplot a line graph in orange showing how the average movie rating (the average of rtAllCriticsRating across all movies in a year) has changed over time.  Do you notice a trend?  What do you think it means?"

From the scatter plots, we see that there is a much larger number of movies made in the later years compared to earlier years. Aditionally, in 1925, the minimum rating was 7 and the maximum was 10. In 1980, the minimum rating was 1 and the maximum rating was 9. This makes sense as to why the mean rating is lower for later years compared to earlier years."

    "Looking at the mis-predictions, it makes sense why we got those specific reviews for fresh and rotten reviews. This is also an issue with using a bag of words approach, because it does not take the sequence of words into account. Additionally, Naive Bayes assumes every feature affects the probability independently of other words. This is why it is called \"Naive\". This is a bad assumption because each word or feature has the likelihood to impact the probability for other features. For example, let's say there were two reviews. The first review with just the word \"Good\", and a second review with the two words \"Not Good\". Our Classifier would predict the first review \"Good\" to have a high percentage to be a fresh review. In the case of the second review, if the probability for the words were not independent from one another, then it could be viewed that \"Not Good\" should have a low percentage to have a fresh review. However, because the probabilities are independent, then P(Fresh|Not) + P(Fresh|Good) = P(Fresh), and we will still get a high probability that it is a fresh review."
