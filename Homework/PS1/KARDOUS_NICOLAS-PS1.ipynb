It looks like when housing prices is high, the crime rate is low, and when housing prices is low, then crime rates are high. We find that the correlation betwen crime and median price is -0.388. Thus, there is a negative correlation between crime and median price. I believe this relationship is correlation and not causal because the absolute value for the coefficient correlation is too low. If the coefficient correlation value was higher, we could denote the relationship as causation."
