    "$G^{(k)}_j=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\\frac{\\partial J^{(i)}(\\alpha,\\beta_1,\\ldots)}{\\partial \\beta_j})^2$ and $R$ is your learning rate. The notation $\\frac{\\partial J^{(i)}(\\alpha,\\beta_1,\\ldots)}{\\partial \\beta_j}$ corresponds to the value of the gradient at iteration $(i)$. Essentially we are \"storing\" information about previous iteration gradients. Doing that we effectively decrease the learning rate slower when a feature $x_i$ is sparse (i.e. has many zero values which would lead to zero gradients). Although this method is not necessary for our regression problem, it is good to be familiar with these methods as they are widely used in neural network training.  "
